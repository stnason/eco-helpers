1. Start a new page:
   Copy the "_copy-me-starter-template.blade.php" to use as a starting 
   point to quickly frame out a new eco-helpers ready (aware) page.

2. Customizing the files:n (2 ways)

   The easiest way, is to add any of your own customized view code 
   directly into the corresponding files in this folder.
   The base app template (core/eh-app-template.blade.php) automatically 
   includes them to build out all pages extending that template.

   You can also create completely new files if you like. Just make sure 
   to specify the filename in the config\eco-helpers.php file. Again, 
   the base app template (core/eh-app-template.blade.php) will use those
   filenames to automatically build out the page.

3. Global app template files:
   [these are the default entries in the config\eco-helpers.php file]:

   Any base template add-ins.      'app_add_ins_file' => 'app-add-ins',
     - this file is empty by default. This is where you can add
       anything extra you'd like included on every page.

   HTML <head> file.               'html_head_file' => 'html-head',
     - specific items to include in the <head> section 
       of the master template.

   CSS loader file.                'css_loader_file' => 'css-loader',
     - a way to include (call) css files per page using the ehLayout class.
       (Not all pages may need the same pile of css files.)

   JS loader file.                 'js_loader_file' => 'js-loader',
    - a way to include (call) JS files per page using the ehLayout class.
       (Not all pages may need the same pile of JS files.)

   navbar header file.             'navbar_header_file' => 'navbar-header',
    - the header at the top of every page. Control its individual
      elements in this file.

   footer file.                    'footer_file' => 'footer-1',
    - the footer at the bottom of every page. Control its individual
      elements in this file.

   Authentication modals           'authentication_modals_file' => 'authentication-modals',
    - the pop-up modals for all of the authentication screens
      including login, registration, change password, forgot password.
      Along with all of the corresponding AJAX JS.
