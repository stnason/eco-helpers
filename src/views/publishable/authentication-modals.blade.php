{{-- You can review the core/he-authentication-modals file to see how it is implemented
     and then copy that code into here and modify it to your needs.

     Aditionally, you can create a new modals file of your own and then chan the config/eco-helpers.php
     setting:
        'authentication_modals_file' => 'authentication-modals',
     to specify the name of that view file. (Just keep it in this folder)
