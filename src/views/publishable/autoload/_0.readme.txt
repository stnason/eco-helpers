!!! DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THESE FILES. !!!

They are used by the $setting system and can be modified here to suite your needs.

The numbers are associated with the $settingers defined in the eco-helpers config file
under layout['auto_loaders'] and can be called from the controller by:

    The name defined in the config file:
    ehLayout::setAutoload('name');

    or the number of that config file array entry:
    ehLayout::setAutoload(1);

    or by passing an array with multiple request numbers in it:
    ehLayout::setAutoload([1,5,7]);


Note: file '0' is the global (all page) loader and will always be loaded.

Each numbered $settinger requires to files to load properly:
    css/1-css-autoload.blade.php
    js/1-js-autoload.blade.php
